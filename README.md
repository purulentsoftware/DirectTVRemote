DirecTV Remote for IOS

I made this about a years ago, so the code is a little old. I plan on going back and fixing some of the code.  

A rough implementation of a directv remote.  This uses the directv network protocols described in the Direct-TV-Remote-Networks-Protocol.pdf (included). 

This app searches for directv boxes on the network that have the network controls setting on. If found you can create a name for the directv box and then do all the basic controls you can do with a regular remote.

This app is using glyphish's 200 free icons http://www.glyphish.com
